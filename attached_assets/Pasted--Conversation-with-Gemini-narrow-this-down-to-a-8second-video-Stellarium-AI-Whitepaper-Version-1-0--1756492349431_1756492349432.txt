Version 1.0 - August 2025

Abstract

Stellarium AI is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network designed to democratize the creation, deployment, and control of artificial intelligence. By leveraging a distributed network of compute and storage providers, Stellarium AI removes the reliance on centralized corporate entities, fostering a more open, secure, and equitable AI ecosystem. The native utility token, $ASTRA, powers the network's economy, incentivizing participation and enabling community-led governance. This document outlines the project's vision, technical architecture, and the tokenomics model that underpins its self-sustaining economy.



1. Introduction

The field of Artificial Intelligence is undergoing a Cambrian explosion of innovation. However, the immense resources required for training and deploying state-of-the-art models have led to a concentration of power within a few large technology corporations. This centralization creates significant barriers to entry, stifles independent research, and raises critical concerns regarding censorship, bias, and control.

Stellarium AI was conceived to solve this problem. Our mission is to build the foundational infrastructure for a new generation of decentralized AI, where control is returned to the hands of creators and users. Inspired by a stellarium that maps the cosmos, our vision is to create a network that can map and navigate the vast, complex universe of artificial intelligence.



2. The Problem with Centralized AI

The current AI paradigm is defined by its centralization, leading to several fundamental issues:



Data & Model Gatekeeping: Centralized entities control both the massive datasets required for training and the resulting models, creating a walled garden that limits access and innovation.

Lack of Transparency: Many AI models operate as "black boxes," making it impossible to audit their decision-making processes for bias or errors.

Censorship & Control: A single entity can decide to censor model outputs, restrict access, or de-platform applications, concentrating immense power.

Prohibitive Costs: The cost of GPU compute power for training and inference is a major barrier for independent developers, researchers, and startups.

Security Vulnerabilities: Centralized servers represent a single point of failure, making them high-value targets for cyberattacks.

3. The Stellarium AI Solution: A Decentralized Architecture

Stellarium AI is built on a multi-layered architecture designed for resilience, security, and scalability.



Layer 1: The P2P Network (The Constellation Layer): This is the foundational layer where nodes connect directly. Participants contribute their idle compute (CPU/GPU) and storage resources. AI models are fragmented, encrypted, and distributed across these nodes using a content-addressable seeding mechanism inspired by BitTorrent and IPFS. This ensures redundancy and censorship resistance.

Layer 2: Blockchain & Governance (The Celestial Sphere): A blockchain serves as the network's trust and coordination layer.

Model Registry: An immutable, on-chain registry for all AI models, providing a transparent and verifiable history of their origin and updates (provenance).

Smart Contracts: Automate all economic activity, including payments for compute, enforcement of usage rights, and the distribution of rewards.

Governance: The Stellarium DAO, powered by the $ASTRA token, allows the community to propose and vote on protocol upgrades and treasury management.

Layer 3: The AI Model Lifecycle (The Orbit): This layer defines the journey of an AI model on the network, from submission and decentralized training (using privacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning) to P2P inference and access, all orchestrated by smart contracts.

4. $ASTRA Tokenomics

The $ASTRA token is the native utility token of the Stellarium AI ecosystem, designed to fuel its economy and align the incentives of all participants.

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $ASTRA (1 Billion), fixed.



4.1. Token Distribution

Community & Ecosystem Fund (40% - 400M $ASTRA): The largest allocation, dedicated to the long-term health of the network. Funds will be used for community grants, developer incentives, liquidity provisioning, and marketing.

Compute & Storage Rewards (25% - 250M $ASTRA): Reserved for block rewards to incentivize nodes providing the computational and storage resources that power the network.

Founding Team & Advisors (15% - 150M $ASTRA): To reward the core team for their foundational work. Subject to a 4-year vesting schedule with a 12-month cliff to ensure long-term alignment.

Token Sale (15% - 150M $ASTRA): To raise capital for development and operations through public and private sale rounds.

Airdrops & Early Supporters (5% - 50M $ASTRA): To reward and bootstrap the initial community of users and testers.

4.2. Token Utility

The $ASTRA token is integral to the functioning of the network and is not merely a speculative asset. Its primary utilities are:



Payment for Services: Users pay in $ASTRA to run inferences on AI models. A portion of this fee goes to the compute provider, and another portion goes to the model's developer.

Staking & Security: Node operators must stake $ASTRA to participate, acting as collateral to ensure honest behavior.

Governance: Staking $ASTRA grants voting power in the DAO, allowing the community to steer the project's future.

Incentivization: Developers are rewarded with a share of the fees their models generate, creating a vibrant marketplace for AI innovation.

5. Roadmap

Phase 1 (Q4 2025): Foundation & Testnet: Launch of the core P2P networking protocol and a public testnet.

Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Mainnet Launch & TGE: Deployment of the main network with blockchain integration and the Token Generation Event for $ASTRA.

Phase 3 (Q4 2026): Ecosystem & Marketplace: Launch of a user-friendly marketplace for discovering and using AI models.

Phase 4 (2027): Transition to DAO: Full transition of network governance to the community-led Stellarium DAO.

6. Conclusion

Stellarium AI represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the development and control of artificial intelligence. By creating a decentralized, community-owned network, we can break free from the limitations of the current centralized model and unlock a more innovative, equitable, and secure AI future for everyone.
